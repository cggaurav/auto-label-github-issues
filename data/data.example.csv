https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/65388,335019459,Always create kubeClusterIPSet in ipvs proxier,**What this PR does / why we need it**:  This PR creates the kubeClusterIPSet ipset even if kube-proxy is started without masqueradeAll and clusterCIDR.  This is necessary to masquerade traffic sent to a clusterIP from the host network namespace. The code to do so is actually already present here: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/proxy/ipvs/proxier.go#L1220-L1244    However the second else (neither masqueradeAll nor clusterCIDR are set) cannot be used because  before this PR  the initial test `if !proxier.ipsetList[kubeClusterIPSet].isEmpty()` can never return true when masqueradeAll and clusterCIDR are not set because kubeClusterIPSet is empty.    **Which issue(s) this PR fixes**   Fixes #65158    ```release-note  Allow access to ClusterIP from the host network namespace when kube-proxy is started in IPVS mode without either masqueradeAll or clusterCIDR flags  ```    **Additional comment**  Issue #65158 is closed because ClusterIP access from the host has already fixed in master  except for the case described here (no masquerade flag).
